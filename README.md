## 📝 Blog Posts  

- **9th September**: [Kubernetes Architecture: Understanding Pods, Nodes, and Clusters](https://medium.com/@javaria/kubernetes-architecture-understanding-pods-nodes-and-clusters-123456789abc)  
  This blog explores the modular architecture of Kubernetes, focusing on its core components: **Clusters**, **Nodes**, and **Pods**.  
  - **Clusters**: Serve as the foundation, managing Nodes that host Pods.  
  - **Nodes**: Provide the compute environment to run Pods.  
  - **Pods**: Smallest deployable units containing one or more containers.  
  It highlights how Kubernetes optimizes resource usage and provides scalability, reliability, and efficiency for application deployment.
  

- **13th October**: [Pulumi vs Terraform: Which is Best for Your Cloud Infrastructure?](https://medium.com/@javariahabib/pulumi-vs-terraform-which-is-best-for-your-cloud-infrastructure-b64d587cb7c4)  
  This blog compares **Pulumi** and **Terraform**, two popular Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools, highlighting their unique features:  
  - **Pulumi**: Offers multi-language support, allowing infrastructure to be defined in general-purpose languages like Python, JavaScript, and C#. Ideal for flexible, reusable code and integration with testing frameworks.  
  - **Terraform**: A mature tool with a declarative syntax (HCL), vast community support, and a large ecosystem of cloud providers. Known for its simplicity and reliable state management.  
  The blog provides examples, feature comparisons, and guidance to help readers decide which tool suits their needs.
